#1. Inspiration
Presence Protocol originated as a pivot after a discussion with XRPL Mentor Tori West, who advised focusing on addressing real-world problems. Reflecting on my experiences with platforms like Luma within my school’s blockchain community, I identified a common issue: attendees often RSVP for smaller events but then fail to attend due to various reasons. This discrepancy leads to significant challenges for event organizers, including inaccurate attendance projections, resource misallocation, and diminished engagement.
For smaller gatherings, even a handful of no-shows can noticeably impact the event’s atmosphere and effectiveness, reducing opportunities for meaningful interactions among committed participants. Presence Protocol seeks to tackle this challenge by creating a stake and attend system that incentivizes genuine commitment. Leveraging blockchain technology, this protocol ensures commitment among attendees, giving organisers a piece of mind.

#2. What It Does
Presence Protocol is a blockchain-powered attendance verification and staking solution designed to improve event engagement and accountability. Using the XRP Ledger, Presence Protocol enables attendees to stake a small amount of cryptocurrency when they RSVP to an event, committing to their attendance. Upon check-in at the event, attendees' staked funds are released back to them, reinforcing accountability and rewarding those who follow through on their commitments. For no-shows, the staked amount may be withheld or redistributed according to predefined rules set by the event organizer, helping organizers manage attendance more accurately and ensuring resources are allocated effectively. Through this transparent and decentralized approach, Presence Protocol addresses the common issue of unreliable RSVPs, creating a more efficient and accountable event ecosystem.

#3. How I Built It
Frontend: React
Blockchain and Backend: xrpl.js and Node.js

#4. Challenge I Ran Into
I ran into some minor challenges while using React as it was my first time. But the biggest challenge I ran into was using the XRPL Blockchain as while I understood it was a consumer, it was totally different when I was trying to use it. I ran into some errors but the program manager, emma was kind enough to guide me through how to troubleshoot and even provide some advice on how to build my app. 

#5. What I Learned
Through developing Presence Protocol, I gained valuable insights into the complexities of blockchain integration. Working with the XRP Ledger taught me the intricacies of blockchain transactions, from handling asynchronous processes in xrpl.js to managing conditional escrow for staking and unstaking. I learnt how to use react, got a chance to try to use pinata and ipfs and I look forward to learning how to use it better.

#6. What's Next  
1. Creating actual accounts instead of hard coding it
2. Better designed landing page
3. Changing the admin page to a login button that leads to another page
4. Improving the admin page


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
